<p>Launching an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster is <strong>NOT</strong> as easy as it should be. If you follow the documentation, these are the steps to take:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an IAM Service Role for EKS.  This only has to be done once.</li>
  <li>You launch a CloudFormation script to create a dedicated VPC (optional). One needs three subnets, one for each AZ that the masters will be deployed into.</li>
  <li>You create your EKS management plane.  This just takes a few clicks in the Console, or a line or two in the CLI.</li>
  <li>Edit the KUBECONFIG file with proper data for server endpoint, certificate authority and IAM info for the heptio authenticator.</li>
  <li>You launch another CloudFormation script, in order to launch your worker nodes.</li>
  <li>You copy the worker node <em>NodeInstanceRole</em> from the CF output, and then use it as input for an authorization config-map.  This allows worker nodes to dynamically join the cluster in a secure manner.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do this a few times, you will find it not too onerous. Also, you can use <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/guides/eks-getting-started.html">Terraform</a> scripting or other tools to glue everthing together. Still, it is <strong>NOT</strong> easy.  If you have worked on GCP or Azure, it is a single line of commands that launches both your masters and workers.  This is 2018 AWS - let‚Äôs polish that API!</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Kubernetes open-source community being what it is, a partner has already solved this problem. <a href="https://www.weave.works">Weaveworks</a> has created a github repo caleld <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl"><em>eksctl</em></a>, and they describe it as ‚Äúa CLI for Amazon EKS‚Äù.  Well, they are right.  In a single line of code, they automate the entire process described above, and brings the ability to launch both masters <strong>and</strong> workers into the realm of us mortals.
