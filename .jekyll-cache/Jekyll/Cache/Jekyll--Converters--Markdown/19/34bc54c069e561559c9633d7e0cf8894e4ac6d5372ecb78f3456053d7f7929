I"<p>A few days ago, it was <a href="http://tauday.com/state-of-the-tau">Tau Day</a> (6/28). I thought that it would also be a good time to re-activate my blog. I hope to add tidbits of code and interesting mathematics from time to time.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">Tau Manifesto</a> was launched back in 2010. 
The central idea is to understand that <em>π</em> is an arbitrary constant, and that it is much easier to teach students about the circle constant if Pi (<em>π</em>) was changed to represent C/r instead of C/d. As that is <em>not</em> about to happen, Michael Hartl, the founder of this movement, has created a new circle constant called tau (<em>τ</em>).</p>

<p>Now, why is tau easier to understand or work with?
Well, if tau represents C/r (6.283185307179586…), then
a full rotation or turn of a circle can be represented as
a single “tau” (in radians of course). One half circle is 1/2 tau, and so on.
I believe that a major stumbling block of students would be removed
if we moved to teaching radian measurements with tau instead of <em>π</em>.</p>

<p>Michael Hartl also goes on to explain how many other
mathematical formulas would also be easier to comprehend.</p>

<p>The animated GIF below, is pretty self-explanatory.</p>
