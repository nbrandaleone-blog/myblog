I"A<p>Hi! Welcome to yet another blog.  Unless you are very lucky to stumble across this site, I will assume that you are lost.  Otherwise, this blog will be a place where I store code snippets, math facts, chess games and other mental dandruff. It is my hope that it will be useful to myself and perhaps others.</p>

<p>As my day job is working on Cloud infrastructure and projects, most of the materials here will most likely be AWS facts and other related bits.</p>

<p>A shout out to my family: Stephanie, Jenna and Ethan. Bark to my dog Jet.</p>
