## Moving Blog to GCP

Everyone, I have accepted a new position to work at Google.

I am very excited about this opportunity, and it offers me a chance to re-boot this blog on top of GCP. Due to COVID-19 and work obligations, I have not been able to blog much recently. My goal is start putting out content again in January 2021. I will continue to post about AWS, but my focus will shift towards GCP products, and comparisons of how to do things on top of both AWS and GCP.

## New URL

So, please head over to my new [site](https://nicks-playground.net)

This current site (_https://nickaws.net_), will no longer receive new content. However, I will slowly shift all my existing content and posts to the new blog shortly.  Nothing will be lost.

**Happ Holidays** to everyone.  May 2021 be a better year for everyone!
