## How expensive is S3 hosting of static content?
It turns out to be dirt cheap. I have included a recent bill, and it is about $1/month. Most of that cost is Route53, and the remainder ($0.06) is CloudFront.  I do not recall if that includes the cost of the domain name.  If it does not, let's call it an additional dollar a month.  Overall, S3 hosting is an extremely cost effective way to host a static web site.
