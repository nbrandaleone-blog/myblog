Hi! Welcome to yet another blog.  Unless you are very lucky to stumble across this site, I will assume that you are lost.  Otherwise, this blog will be a place where I store code snippets, math facts, chess games and other mental dandruff. It is my hope that it will be useful to myself and perhaps others.

As my day job is working on Cloud infrastructure and projects, most of the materials here will most likely be AWS facts and other related bits.

A shout out to my family: Stephanie, Jenna and Ethan. Bark to my dog Jet.

def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('family!')
{% endhighlight %}
