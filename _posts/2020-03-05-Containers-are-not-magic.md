# Containers are not magic

I don't often call out other bloggers, but I do want to mention the great work of [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/). She is a blogger, speaker and programmer. I have really enjoyed her posts, in particular her cartoons.

This post is just to highlight how **simple** containers really are.  Sometimes, they seem like *magic*. Well, you can create your own [container](https://gist.github.com/jvns/ea2e4d572b4e2285148b8e87f70eed73) in 15 lines of bash. Go ahead - it won't take long!

While I am giving kudos, one should also watch Liz Rice on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc).  She gives a wonderful demo of building your own container using Go. Liz is a security expert, currently working at [Acqua Security](https://www.aquasec.com/)
