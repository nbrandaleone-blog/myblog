A few days ago, it was [Tau Day](http://tauday.com/state-of-the-tau) (6/28). I thought that it would also be a good time to re-activate my blog. I hope to add tidbits of code and interesting mathematics from time to time.

The [Tau Manifesto](http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto) was launched back in 2010. 
The central idea is to understand that _&pi;_ is an arbitrary constant, and that it is much easier to teach students about the circle constant if Pi (_&pi;_) was changed to represent C/r instead of C/d. As that is *not* about to happen, Michael Hartl, the founder of this movement, has created a new circle constant called tau (_&tau;_).

Now, why is tau easier to understand or work with?
Well, if tau represents C/r (6.283185307179586...), then
a full rotation or turn of a circle can be represented as
a single "tau" (in radians of course). One half circle is 1/2 tau, and so on.
I believe that a major stumbling block of students would be removed
if we moved to teaching radian measurements with tau instead of _&pi;_.

Michael Hartl also goes on to explain how many other
mathematical formulas would also be easier to comprehend.
